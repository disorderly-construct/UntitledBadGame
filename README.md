Game Name is a 2D top-down RPG currently in progress.

## Description

The game features a unique day and night mechanic where the gameplay differs between the two time periods. During the day, the game world is lucid, and you interact with townsfolk, uncovering the story and objectives. However, when night falls, the game world becomes insane, and you embark on a mission to eliminate what are perceived to be demons.

## Gameplay Overview

- **Daytime**: Interact with townsfolk, discover quests, and progress the storyline.
- **Nighttime**: Engage in combat, eliminate enemies perceived as demons.
- **Morning**: Clean up and hide the evidence of your activities from the previous night.
- **Next Area**: As the game progresses, the guard grants access to the next area of the town, where you repeat the cycle.

## Features
